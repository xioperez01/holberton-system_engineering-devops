In computing, a [firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_%28computing%29) is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.
