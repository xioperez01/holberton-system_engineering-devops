# MySQL
### database (DB)
A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.

A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Collectively, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with it, are known as a database system, often boiling down to just databases.
### MySQL
MySQL is an open source database management software that helps users store, organize, and retrieve data.
### Redundancy
Data redundancy is the duplication or rewriting of information with the intention of increasing system reliability, usually in the form of storage backup or failure testing.
