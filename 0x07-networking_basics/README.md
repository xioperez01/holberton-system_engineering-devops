The **Open Systems Interconnection model[(OSI model)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)** is a conceptual model that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard communication protocols.
